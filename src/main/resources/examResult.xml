It operates and manages the federal government's only vaccine manufacturing facilities (VPP, BDP), and runs the high-performance Advanced Biomedical Computing Center. It also operates the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center focused on cancer and AIDS research. The Employer Biomedical Research Groups Biospecimen Research Group (BRG) supports The National Cancer Institutes (NCI) Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch (BBRB) and are jointly responsible for developing a common biorepository infrastructure that promotes resource sharing and team science, to facilitate multi-institutional, high throughput genomic and proteomic studies. Currently, Employer Biomed is supporting The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer MoonshotSM Programs Cancer Moonshot Biobanking program.  The NCIs Cancer Moonshot program is intended to accelerate cancer research in key strategic areas. The strategic areas were deliberated and identified by experts in the cancer research community convened in 2016 through a Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP). The BRP produced a set of recommendations that are now publicly available (<a href=\"\">Employer</a> The strategic areas addressed in the BRP recommendations have in common two core elements: 1) critical scientific and medical questions, the answers to which could rapidly accelerate progress in cancer research, and 2) the need for nationwide participation by a diverse group of research participants who have agreed to share their biospecimens and/or derived data for the purpose of contributing to progress in cancer research. The latter element, an engaged and diverse research participant population and their donations of biospecimens and data, will be critical to accelerating research progress and is the subject of the project for which Employer Biomed is seeking an experienced IT Manager.  The Cancer MoonshotSM Biobank will provide a networked biospecimen resource which will serve the goal of the Cancer Moonshot to accelerate research progress in cancer.  </font></font></p> <p class=\"MsoNormalCxSpMiddle\" style=\"margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
